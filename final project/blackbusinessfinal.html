<h1 class="head" id="history"> History </h1>
<p>Black-owned businesses have been around since post Civil War. Many businesses started around the Reconstruction Era, a time known for its impact around the African-American community. Starting in the mid 1860's, The Reconstruction Era lasted until 1877. After the Union won the war, this time was dedicated to fixing the problems between the two conflicting sides.</p>

<p>During this era, the Reconstructions Acts of 1867 were passed which were statutes that were required for the Southern states to be readmitted with the northern states. A few big things that came from this time were the 14th(1868) and 15th(1870) amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment provided former slaves with national citizenship while the Fifteenth amendment granted Black men the right to vote. </p>

</center>

<p>After the reconstruction era, there was a flourish of black-owned businesses in urban areas. Some of the businesses that were easily accessible for Black people to own were Barber, Dressmaker, etc. </p>

<p>The “Golden age of black business” as historian Juliet Walker calls it, was from 1900-1930 because of the influx of business owners from the community. With Jim Crow Laws being prominent during this time, the Black community created businesses for themselves. The National Negro Business League or NNBL, was created in the early 1900s to “further the economic development of the African American businesses in order to achieve social equality in the American society.”</p>

<p> Some influential people from this time include: </p>

<p> After this time, penical parts of the Black business world was the Civil Rights Movement and the Civil Rights Act which made it illegal to discriminate because of race, sex, etc. Because of acts like this and many since its time, business owners in the black community have been able to develop and prosper. </p>


<h1 class="head" id="stats"> Statistics </h1>

<p>Since the late 19th century to present day, black businesses have been on the rise. With the accessibility of technology and education, people are opening up more businesses. </p>

<p>In the 2015 US Census report, there is a 34.5% increase in black businesses from 2007 to 2012. </p>

<p>In a survey from Guidant Financial from 2018, the numbers show a steady increase. With the number of businesses being owned by minorities increasing to 45%, there is a constant change going on, especially with numbers increasing from 15%.  In addition to these numbers, there is still a gap between Black men and women with men dominating the demographics of owners with it being an average of almost 2 black men owners to 1 black woman owner. </p>

<p>In Washington DC, Black businesses are only accounted for 28% of all businesses while in Maryland, they are only accounted for 20%. Other states including New York, Georgia, Texas and other states having blooming black businesses. </p>

<p>While these numbers are impressive, they are still not as high as they could be. Even with African-Americans being only 13% of the U.S population, they do own a large amount of businesses compared to White or Hispanic/Latino American.</p>

<p>To increase the numbers we need to offer resources and support for Black Americans that are trying to open their own business. If you are looking to support black owned business, there are multiple <a href="https://officialblackwallstreet.com/directory/">online</a> directories to help find black businesses in your state. </p>
